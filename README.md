- Food Shopping Cart (Console Program)

This is a simple **console-based shopping cart application** written in Python.
It allows users to add food items (or any items) along with their prices and calculates the total cost at the end.

While it is labeled as a "Food" shopping cart, you can easily use it for general-purpose item shopping by replacing the word **"food"** with **"item"** in the code.

# Features:
- Add multiple food items to your cart.
- Input the price for each item.
- View a summary of items added.
- Automatically calculates and displays the total cost.
- Case-insensitive quitting using `'q'` or `'Q'`.

# Example Run:

Enter a food to buy (q to quit): Apple
Enter the price of a Apple: $1.50
Enter a food to buy (q to quit): Bread
Enter the price of a Bread: $2.25
Enter a food to buy (q to quit): q
-----YOUR CART-----
Apple Bread 
Your total is: $3.75
